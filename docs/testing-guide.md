```

### Specialized Debug Tools

The `tests/debug/` directory contains specialized debugging scripts for investigating complex issues:

```bash
# Run a debug script directly
python -m tests.debug.debug_exception_trace

# Use with specific arguments
python -m tests.debug.debug_status_logic --verbose
```

These tools are valuable when standard unit tests aren't sufficient to diagnose an issue. They're especially useful for AI coding assistants to pinpoint root causes without having to run interactive debugging sessions.

See the `README.md` in the debug directory for:
- Details on each script's purpose and usage
- Specific guidance for developer agents (AI assistants)
- Recommended workflows for diagnosing complex issues

### Centralized Infrastructure

All logging and temporary directories are centralized under the `logs/` folder:

```
logs/
├── download_service/     # Download service error reports
├── download_state/       # Download resume state management
├── failed_downloads/     # Failed download tracking & recovery
├── jobs/                 # Job processing records
├── recovery_plans/       # Recovery plan generation
├── error_reports/        # System-wide error logging
├── playlist_results/     # Playlist processing results
├── runtime/             # Runtime performance logs
└── temp/               # Temporary files during operations
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic cleanup after test sessions
- Consistent temp directory patterns
- Better debugging with organized structure
- Production-ready logging organization
- Complete test isolation with dedicated directories

> **📚 For detailed logging architecture documentation**, see the comprehensive "Logging Architecture" section in `docs/user-guide.md` which explains the purpose, content types, and usage patterns for each directory.

## 🧠 Memory Leak Detection

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all memory leak tests
uv run pytest -m memory

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -m memory -v

# Run specific service memory tests
uv run pytest tests/memory/test_download_memory_leaks.py -m memory
uv run pytest tests/memory/test_metadata_memory_leaks.py -m memory
uv run pytest tests/memory/test_storage_memory_leaks.py -m memory
uv run pytest tests/memory/test_retry_memory_leaks.py -m memory
```

### Retry Component Memory Testing

**NEW**: Comprehensive memory leak detection for retry system components:

```bash
# Test retry system memory patterns
uv run pytest tests/memory/test_retry_memory_leaks.py -v
```

**Components Tested:**
- **ErrorRecoveryManager**: Active recovery tracking and cleanup during long operations
- **CircuitBreakerStrategy**: State transition memory patterns (Open/Closed/Half-Open)
- **AdaptiveStrategy**: Sliding window metrics and retry accumulation patterns
- **Long-Running Retry Sequences**: Extended retry operations with proper cleanup

**Memory Validation Thresholds:**
- **Peak Memory**: < 50MB during complex retry operations
- **Final Memory**: < 10MB after cleanup
- **Leak Detection**: Zero memory leaks across all retry components

### Memory Performance Results

All services and components have been rigorously tested:

| Component | Peak Memory | Final Memory | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Download Service** | ~1.2 MB | Normal | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Metadata Service** | ~1.4 MB | Normal | ✅ Acceptable |
| **Storage Service** | ~0.1 MB | Normal | ✅ Excellent |
| **ErrorRecoveryManager** | < 40MB | < 8MB | ✅ Zero Leaks |
| **CircuitBreakerStrategy** | < 25MB | < 3MB | ✅ Zero Leaks |
| **AdaptiveStrategy** | < 50MB | < 10MB | ✅ Zero Leaks |

## 🔗 Cross-Service Integration Testing

## 📊 Test Execution Strategies

### By Category

```bash
# Run tests by category
uv run pytest -m unit          # Unit tests
uv run pytest -m service       # Service tests
uv run pytest -m integration   # Integration tests (Enhanced coverage)
uv run pytest -m e2e           # End-to-end tests
uv run pytest -m memory        # Memory leak tests (Including retry components)
uv run pytest -m performance   # Performance tests
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Quick memory validation during development
uv run pytest -m memory -v

# Test specific service during debugging
uv run pytest tests/memory/test_download_memory_leaks.py -m memory

# Run integration tests for cross-service validation
uv run pytest -m integration -v
```

### Production Validation

```bash
# Comprehensive analysis with professional reports
python tests/memory/run_memory_leak_tests.py

# Full integration validation
uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Check generated reports
ls -la tests/memory/reports/
cat tests/memory/reports/memory_leak_report_*.txt
```

### CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Fast failure detection
uv run pytest --tb=short --maxfail=1

## Code Quality Validation

YTArchive maintains enterprise-grade code quality through comprehensive linting, formatting, and type checking.

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all code quality checks through UV environment
uv run ruff check  # Linting
uv run black --check .  # Formatting
uv run mypy .  # Type checking

# Or run all checks through pre-commit
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

> **⚠️ Important**: Always use `uv run` prefix when running tools to ensure proper environment integration.

### Pre-commit Configuration

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality standards are maintained on every commit. The configuration is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and includes:

- trim trailing whitespace
- fix end of files
- check yaml
- check for added large files
- black (formatting)
- ruff (linting)
- mypy (type checking)

### Type Safety Guidelines

For comprehensive documentation on type safety in this project, refer to these WatchOut guides:

- `Planning/WatchOut/type-safety-guide.md`: Best practices for ensuring type safety with MyPy
- `Planning/WatchOut/mypy-uv-environment-mismatch.md`: Troubleshooting environment integration issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Import Order Issues**: Place `sys.path.insert` before other imports to avoid E402 errors.

2. **Type Stub Recognition**: When installing type stubs with UV, ensure pre-commit hooks run mypy in the same environment:
   ```bash
   uv add --dev types-package-name
   uv run mypy --install-types --non-interactive
   ```

3. **Function Name Shadowing**: Never name functions after built-in types like `list`, `dict`, etc.

4. **UV Environment Integration**: Use the local hook pattern for pre-commit configuration with UV.

# Memory Leak Detection

# Use exit codes for automated decisions
python tests/memory/run_memory_leak_tests.py
echo "Exit code: $?"
# 0 = Success, 1 = Critical issues, 2 = High-severity issues
```
