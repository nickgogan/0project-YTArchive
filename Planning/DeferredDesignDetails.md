# Deferred Design Details

This document lists design details deferred to the implementation phase to be decided as the system is built.

## 1. Service Startup & Shutdown
- Service Daemonization: Consider using a process manager (e.g., supervisord, systemd) for easier startup and shutdown
- Graceful Shutdown: Implement signal handlers to support graceful shutdown (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM)

## 2. Testing Strategy & Tools
- Testing Libraries: Test using `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and related tools listed under dev dependencies
- Mock Services: Use mocking libraries and strategies for simulating external services
- Test Coverage: Decide on code coverage targets and integrate coverage reporting using `pytest-cov`
- Integration Tests: Develop a suite of integration tests to verify interaction between services
- Contract Tests: Utilize tools for contract testing between services to ensure API compatibility

## 3. Monitoring & Alerting
- Metrics Collection: Use `structlog` to capture structured metrics and logs
- Error Alerting: Explore simple rule-based alerting options (logging levels as alerts) and extend to a centralized alert system if needed

## 4. User Documentation
- CLI Help: Implement comprehensive `--help` options for all CLI commands using `click`'s built-in support
- API Documentation: Generate and host API documentation (preferably using OpenAPI or Swagger specification generated by `fastapi`)
- Usage Guides: Develop guides for common tasks (e.g., downloading metadata, managing errors) as usage examples in the README

## 5. Optimization 
- Async I/O: Investigate the potential for optimizing using `asyncio` for I/O-bound operations to enhance parallelism

## 6. Security Considerations
- Content Restrictions: Potentially implement support for respecting video and content restrictions

## 7. Advanced Features
- Service Autoscaling: Evaluate autoscaling needs if workloads increase; initially scale by manual deployment
- Persistent Queues: Evaluate need and options for persistent messaging queues if message passing grows complex
