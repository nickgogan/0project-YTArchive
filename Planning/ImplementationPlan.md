3. All public APIs must have docstrings
4. Use type hints throughout

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all business logic
2. Integration tests for service communication
3. End-to-end tests for critical paths
4. Mock external dependencies (YouTube API, file system)

### Daily Workflow
1. Review planned tasks
2. Write tests first (TDD)
3. Implement feature
4. Update documentation
5. Commit with descriptive message
6. Update CHANGELOG.md

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature is implemented and working
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review for solo project)
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Type checking passes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **YouTube API Changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstract API calls, version pin yt-dlp

2. **Service Communication Failures**
   - Mitigation: Implement circuit breakers, comprehensive retries

3. **Large File Handling**
   - Mitigation: Stream downloads, implement progress tracking

### Schedule Risks
1. **Underestimated Complexity**
   - Mitigation: MVP first, defer advanced features

2. **External Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Mock everything, test offline

## Success Metrics

### MVP (v0.1.0)
- Successfully download single videos
- Handle common error cases gracefully
- All services communicate reliably
- Basic CLI is functional

### v0.2.0
- Playlist support working
- 95%+ download success rate
- Performance meets requirements (<1GB memory)
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1.1 - Project Setup
2. Set up development environment
3. Create initial commit with project structure
4. Start implementing common infrastructure

Remember: Focus on getting a working MVP first. Advanced features can always be added later.
