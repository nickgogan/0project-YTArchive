# YTArchive Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized implementation plan for the YTArchive project, organized in phases with clear deliverables and estimated timelines.

## Overview

### Implementation Philosophy
- Start with foundational services and build incrementally
- Each service should be independently testable
- Focus on MVP features first, defer advanced functionality
- Maintain clean service boundaries throughout

### Critical Path
Jobs Service → Logging Service → Storage Service → Metadata Service → Download Service → CLI

## Current Status (2025-08-02)

### ✅ **MVP Complete**
- **Unit Tests**: ✅ 210/210 passing | **Service Tests**: ✅ 186/186 passing | **Integration Tests**: ✅ 55/55 passing

- [x] Fix all identified bugs
- [x] Test infrastructure optimization

### 4.2 Documentation
- [x] User guide with examples
- [x] API documentation
- [x] Service deployment guide
- [x] Configuration reference
- [x] Professional README and CHANGELOG

### 4.3 MVP Release Preparation
- [x] Create release scripts
- [x] Package for distribution
- [x] Final testing on clean environment

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features ✅ COMPLETED

### 5.1 Playlist Support
- [x] CLI playlist command group (`ytarchive playlist download/info/status`)
- [x] Batch job creation in Jobs service
- [x] Playlist progress tracking
- [x] Optimization for large playlists

### 5.2 Advanced Error Recovery
- [x] Error recovery library foundation
- [x] Download service integration
- [x] Comprehensive retry strategies (exponential backoff, circuit breaker, adaptive)

## Future Features (Backlog)

### Download Enhancements
- [ ] **Partial Download Resume Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement partial download state management
  - [ ] Add resumable download capability with server validation
  - [ ] Create resume endpoints and CLI commands
  - [ ] Test partial download scenarios and edge cases

### CLI & Monitoring
- [ ] **Error Recovery CLI Commands**
  - [ ] Create error recovery CLI commands for monitoring and management

## Roadmap (Q3-2025)

### 1. **Performance & Load-testing**
   - Benchmark concurrent downloads at scale
   - Stress-test metadata & storage services under burst traffic

### 2. **Packaging & Deployment**
   - Publish first public PyPI release (`ytarchive==0.1.0`)
   - Provide Docker images for each micro-service

### 3. **Cloud Readiness**
   - Terraform modules for AWS deployment
   - Helm charts for Kubernetes option

### 4. **Documentation Polish**
   - Update user guide with new CLI sub-commands (diagnostics, recovery)
   - Add architecture diagram and sequence diagrams

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
1. All code must pass `mypy --strict`
2. Test coverage minimum: 80%
3. All public APIs must have docstrings
4. Use type hints throughout

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all business logic
2. Integration tests for service communication
3. End-to-end tests for critical paths
4. Mock external dependencies (YouTube API, file system)

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature is implemented and working
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review for solo project)
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Type checking passes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **YouTube API Changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstract API calls, version pin yt-dlp

2. **Service Communication Failures**
   - Mitigation: Implement circuit breakers, comprehensive retries

3. **Large File Handling**
   - Mitigation: Stream downloads, implement progress tracking

### Schedule Risks
1. **Underestimated Complexity**
   - Mitigation: MVP first, defer advanced features

2. **External Dependencies**
   - Mitigation: Mock everything, test offline

## Success Metrics

### v0.2.0+
- Playlist support working
- 95%+ download success rate
- Performance meets requirements (<1GB memory)
- Comprehensive test coverage
