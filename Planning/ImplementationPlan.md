# YTArchive Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized implementation plan for the YTArchive project, organized in phases with clear deliverables and estimated timelines.

## Overview

### Implementation Philosophy
- Start with foundational services and build incrementally
- Each service should be independently testable
- Focus on MVP features first, defer advanced functionality
- Maintain clean service boundaries throughout

### Critical Path
Jobs Service → Logging Service → Storage Service → Metadata Service → Download Service → CLI

## Current Status (2025-08-02)
