## Phase 1: Service Configuration Classes (Days 1-3)

### Day 1: Configuration Classes Creation
- [ ] Create Jobs Service Config (`services/jobs/config.py`) - Dev A
- [ ] Create Metadata Service Config (`services/metadata/config.py`) - Dev B
- [ ] Create Download Service Config (`services/download/config.py`) - Dev C
- [ ] Create Storage Service Config (`services/storage/config.py`) - Dev D
- [ ] Create Logging Service Config (`services/logging/config.py`) - Dev E

**Day 1 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All 5 configuration classes created with consistent patterns
- [ ] Unit tests pass for all configuration classes
- [ ] Memory leak tests pass for configuration instantiation
- [ ] Code review completed for pattern compliance

### Day 2: Service Integration
- [ ] Jobs Service Integration (`services/jobs/main.py`) - Dev A
- [ ] Metadata Service Integration (`services/metadata/main.py`) - Dev B
- [ ] Download Service Integration (`services/download/main.py`) - Dev C
- [ ] Storage Service Integration (`services/storage/main.py`) - Dev D
- [ ] Logging Service Integration (`services/logging/main.py`) - Dev E
- [ ] Service Startup Testing - All Devs

**Day 2 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All services start successfully with configuration system
- [ ] Service orchestration patterns unchanged (especially Jobs service)
- [ ] All service-to-service communication functional

### Day 3: Enhanced Health Checks
- [ ] Base Service Health Enhancement (`services/common/base.py`) - Senior Dev
- [ ] Health Endpoint Testing - All Devs

**Day 3 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All health endpoints enhanced and functional
- [ ] Configuration status accurately reflects system state

## Phase 2: CLI Configuration Integration (Days 4-5)

### Day 4: Dynamic Service URL Loading
- [ ] Configuration Loading Function (`cli/main.py`) - Senior Dev
- [ ] YTArchiveAPI Class Update (`cli/main.py`) - Senior Dev
- [ ] CLI Service Discovery Testing - Mid-level Dev
- [ ] CLI Response Time Validation - Mid-level Dev

**Day 4 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] CLI loads service URLs from configuration correctly
- [ ] CLI falls back to defaults when configuration missing
- [ ] All existing CLI functionality preserved

### Day 5: Configuration File Option & Enhanced Validation
- [ ] CLI Configuration File Option (`cli/main.py`) - Senior Dev
- [ ] Enhanced Configuration Validation (`cli/main.py`) - Senior Dev
- [ ] CLI Integration Testing - Mid-level Dev

**Day 5 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] `--config-file` option functional across relevant commands
- [ ] Configuration validation comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] Error messages clear and actionable

---

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing & Validation (Day 6)

### Day 6: Testing Framework & Final Validation
- [ ] Configuration Class Unit Tests - Devs A & B
- [ ] Integration Testing - Devs C & D
- [ ] Memory Leak Testing - Senior Dev
- [ ] Performance Validation - Mid-level Dev

**Day 6 Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All 451+ existing tests still passing
- [ ] New configuration tests passing (unit, integration, memory)
- [ ] Zero memory leaks detected in configuration operations
- [ ] Performance regression within acceptable limits
