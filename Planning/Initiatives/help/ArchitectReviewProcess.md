## 🎯 **Review Process Overview**

The architect review process ensures that research findings are **realistically applicable** to the current project from both **philosophical** and **technical** perspectives, providing a systematic evaluation framework for initiative approval.

### **Review Objectives**
1. **Validate Technical Feasibility**: Ensure research findings can be practically implemented within existing architecture
2. **Assess Philosophical Alignment**: Verify research recommendations align with project philosophy and principles
3. **Identify Implementation Gaps**: Find areas requiring additional research or architect-led enhancement
4. **Provide Implementation Guidance**: Create actionable implementation roadmaps based on research findings
5. **Establish Quality Assurance**: Define acceptance criteria and validation procedures
